DCC and FAIRsharing have aligned three community-developed data policy description efforts, making it easier than ever to create FAIR-aligned data policies and make policy descriptions more accessible to both humans and machines. The FAIRsharing data policy registry, the FAIRsFAIR FAIR data Policy Checklist, and the RDA\u2019s Journal Policy Features have all been aligned and integrated within the FAIRsharing data model. Details of this collaboration, and how to implement it, are provided within joint news items (DCC news item, FAIRsharing news item).

Workshops have two objectives: <ul> <li>First, most M4M Workshops focus on a simple but extensible conceptual model and RDF schema that solve clearly identified FAIR-related metadata goals for that domain. Based on numerous considerations, the metadata expert will recommend if a new schema should be created or if an existing schema can be efficiently repurposed. In most cases, it is also possible to employ metadata modeling tools to build reusable metadata templates following that schema providing user-friendly interfaces and input forms. This will later allow domain experts who may not have technical skills, to nonetheless create metadata instances without expert supervision. The second objective of a M4M Workshop is the deposition of the defined metadata schema/template into a FAIR repository, where they can be easily found and reused by other communities that often have similar metadata requirements. The overall goal of a M4M Workshop is a public Declaration by the domain community to the use and reuse of particular FAIR metadata schema/templates. This declaration could take the form of a FAIR Implementation Profile or a statement in a Data Management Plan. M4M Workshops draw on the deep knowledge collected in many scientific communities but also ensure coordination with the metadata components chosen in other M4M workshops. Collectively, the M4M workshop series result in recommendations about metadata and an Open repository of machine-ready, easy to use and interoperable FAIR metadata templates and components. Anyone can access this \u2019sea\u2019 of community specific metadata templates/components, re-use them as they see fit, and deploy them using metadata editors and other data capture tools.
